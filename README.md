# interactive_pricing
This is interactive pricing page from www.frontendmentor.io challange page for frontend developers. It was created to look like target desing (jpg files) and work according to description.  I am adding first version by now, becouse I see there should be some elements changed to work more properly. I am consciour it can be created in a better way.  
I've used here BEM + CSS (SASS: scss), HTML, JS and tools like VSCode, PerfectPicel for Chrome.
