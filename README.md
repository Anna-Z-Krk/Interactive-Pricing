# interactive_pricing
This is an interactive pricing page from the challenges page www.frontplementor.io for frontend developers. It was created to look like the target project (jpg files) and to function as described.  


I am now adding the first version because I can see that some elements should be changed to make them work more correctly. I am aware that it can be created better.  


Here I used BEM + CSS (SASS: scss), HTML, JS and tools such as VSCode, PerfectPicel for Chrome.
