# interactive_pricing
This is an interactive pricing page from the challenges page www.frontendmentor.io for frontend developers. It was created to look like the target project (jpg files) and to function as described.  

I am aware that it can be created better.  


Here I used BEM + CSS (SASS: scss), HTML, JS and tools such as VSCode, PerfectPixel for Chrome.
