# Interactive Pricing
This is an Interactive Pricing page from the challenges page www.frontendmentor.io (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8) for frontend developers. It was created to look like the target project (jpg files) and to function as described.  

I am aware that it can be created better way. I am practising and learning this way.

Here I used BEM + CSS (SASS: scss), HTML, JS and tools such as VSCode, PerfectPixel for Chrome.
